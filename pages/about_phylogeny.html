<p>This tree is based on sequences from chloroplast DNA. It is rooted in the cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), the first organisms to use oxygen-producing photosynthesis and the ancestors of today's chloroplasts. They are chiefly responsible for establishing our oxygen-rich atmosphere. The red algae, the oldest lineage (~1200 million years old) and the green algae (~600 million years old) acquired their chloroplasts by engulfing and enslaving ancestral cyanobacteria in an evolutionary process called primary endosymbiosis. In turn, an ancestral red algae was engulfed and enslaved, evolving into the chloroplast of the brown algae, via secondary endosymbiosis.</p>

<p>
The red algae are represented by the relictual Glaucophyte lineage and the robust Bangiophyte/Florideophyte lineage.  The green algal lineage contains the ancestors of the bryophytes and vascular plants.  The brown algal lineage is part of a diverse group of organisms, the stramenopiles, that includes water molds, the malaria parasite and other "protists".
