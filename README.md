California Seaweed eFlora Project

This is a clone of the code developed by David Baxter and developed using Github (itsdavidbaxter/seaweedflora).  
The original website was developed by David in 2015 and Jason Alexander helped with finishing the project from October 2016-December 2016.
Jason Alexander continued to improve the code for this website in 2017.  The changes were uploaded to David's seaweedflora repository 
as well as this one.  This repository remains the final repository for this project as of August 2017.

Project Overview: The California Seaweeds eFlora includes a current list of seaweeds (multicellular red, green and brown algae) reported 
to occur in California, including current names, additions to the flora since Abbott & Hollenberg (1976), and non-native species. 
For ~300 species that can be identified without a microscope, a non-technical portal provides photographs, interactive visual keys, and 
information about identification, nomenclature, distribution, and life history.
